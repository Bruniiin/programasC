C++/C# Repository. All these projects are made to build my portfolio and to show my game developer skills I've been developing for the past 6 years.

Projects:

**Star Wars Fangame**

I wanted to learn the intricacies of C++ and started a hobby project inspired by Star Wars: Battlefront series and Nintendo-style gameplay (player agency and enforcement). It's a 2D/topdown open-world game where the player can get on spaceships, take off and visit other planets, inspired by Elite. The player can equip a variety of weapons and shoot at enemies on foot or inside a vehicle, featuring space and planetary battles. Currently it has two game modes: Sandbox and Empire vs. Rebels, which the player gives orders to a team against A.I. or another player, with the condition of defeating the other team. Eventually I want to remove the SW IP it started as and rebrand this project into an open-world space game.

Current features:
1. Singleplayer sandbox mode inspired by Elite and other space games.
2. Space travel.
3. Basic inventory system.
4. Basic RPG and immersive sim elements.
5. M/KB and gamepad support.

**Future projects**:

1. A DnD inspired game which i'll be developing using a dedicated engine. It is also inspired by one of my favorite multiplayer games on the NES, Hyaku Sekai no Monogatari, like Wargroove is an spiritual successor to Advance Wars. It's a very unknown game and there's nothing quite like it. It has some DnD elements such as a game master that controls the scenario and enemies trying to stop the players from beating the game.

2. My take on the Strand genre created by Hideo Kojima, and what I thought Death Stranding would originally be like.
